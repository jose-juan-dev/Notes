# The Odin Project

Introduction
- The Odin project is an open source project and will take you from
zero to a full stack developer.

- First the course will dive into the internet and our own computer and how it works,
then hop into the development enviornment, git, and github. Once done we will dive
into the front-end dev and lastly dive into the back-end dev.

How will this work?
- Most lessons will pull together the ebst content from across the internet, for one topic.
Each lesson will cover topics and provide context, and point you towards the right direction and good resources.

- Think of the Odin project not as a class but as a snowball of knowledge.
