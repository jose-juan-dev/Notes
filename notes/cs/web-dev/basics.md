# Web-dev basics (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)

- Sites can be created using a variety of programming languages, each of which has its purpose and reasons for exsiting.

- The main languages however, are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### HTML

- (Hypertext Markup Language) or HTML is a markup language, that allows the developers to create and add
content but structure to the site itself.

- You can look at HTML as the Foundations of a house, can't see it unless you know where to look
but without it you just got pretty walls with little to no purpose.

### CSS

- (Cascading Style Sheets) or CSS is a static language, who's sole purpose is to prettify.. a site,
make it barable for the user to use and pleasant to see and use.

- You can look at CSS as the walls of the house, with a good foundation and some nice walls and paint
you got yourself a damn good thing, thats not just functional but 'pretty'

### JavaScript

- Javascript is a programming language, to make there sites more interactive at least at the moment
looking at it from the front-end of things. This language is the most complex of the three we listed before,
but also the most useful in a sense, with basic understanding you can change and manipulate parts of your site,
to be able to perform a wide range of actions.

- You can look at JavaScript as the door, the appliances, the stuff you dont need but make our lives
easier, and nice to have around, with a good foundation, some nice walls, and some decent appliances you got youreself a damn nice house.
