# How does the internet work?

### Intro

- The internet is not the world wide web. The Internet is the fiber wires that connect
the computers together, connects clients and server side devices.

- The Internet began in the 1960s as a US army research program, evolved into a public
infrastructure in the 1980s with support from universities and companies.

### Deeper Dive

A simple network

- When two computers need to communicate, you must link them using either physically (ethernet)
or wirelessly using (wifi or bluetooth)

- A network is not limited to two computers, for example connecting 10 computers together
would require 45 cables and 9 plugs per computer. How to solve this?

router

- A router is a special tiny computer that has only one job, think of it as a signaler at a railway station,
makes sure that a message sent from one computer is sent to the correct destination, using this
those 45 cables have been turned to just 10 cables and 10 plugs.

A network of networks

- You can't conect millions of computers to one router but, we are able to connect a router
with its own network of connections to another router, (router to router connection) and can scale infinitely.

- Still not the internet, just a massive network, not possible to set cables between your house and the rest of the world.

modem

- A modem fixes that problem, a modem uses the telephone infrastructure that does connect to the rest of the world,
it does this by turning our information from our network into information manageable by the telephone infrastructure.

- We are now connected to the rest of the world but how are we going to send messages from network to networks

Internet Service Provider (ISP)

- ISP's solve this problem an ISP is a company that manages special routers that are linked together
and can access other ISP routers, The internet consists of this whole infrastructure of networks.

- Path way my laptop -> router -> att modem -> ISP router -> ISP router -> modem -> router -> servers

IP address

- IP also known as Internet protocal is an address made of four numbers seperated by dots (192.0.2.172)

- This is what the browser needs to find a site to make it easier on us we use a human readable name,
known as a domain name that is tied to their server IP address

### Internet and the web

- The internet is an infrustructure the physical wires and network connections

- The web is a servicec that is built on top of the infrastructure.

### Intranets and Extranets

- Intrants are private networks that are restricted to members of a particular organization and only that group,
commonly used to provide portal for members to securely access shared resources, to collaborate and communicate.

- Extranets are similar to intrants but they are open portions or part of a private network to allow
sharing and collaboration with other organizations.
