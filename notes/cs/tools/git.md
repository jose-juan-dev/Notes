# Introduction to Git

- Git is simply a version control system, allows you to look back and restore file states from
past if need be.

- Git is local machine version control, while GitHub is remote storage on the web.

### Version Control

Version Control

- Version control is a system that records changes to a file over time that you can
recall specific version later.

Distributed version control systems

- Ex. (Git) in these Types of systems clients check out the full mirror of the repository
including its full history rather than a snapshot. Means if the server were to go down
every client that is working with you has a mirror and can simply be reuploaded.

### What is Git

- Difference between git and other VCS, is the way it thinks about data, other version controlers,
think of it as a set of files with cahnges made to each over time, Git on the other hand
doesn't do that and simply takes a snapshot of what your files look like the moment of the change
and allows you to reference if you need to. Does not store files again if they were not the ones changed.

- Git needs only local files and resources to operate, which is what makes it so damn
fast and powerful.

### 3 stages of Git

Modified

- Means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.

Staged

- Means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next
commit snapshot.

Commited

- Means that the data is safely stored in your local database.
